# GIAB Stratifications

This repository contains the pipeline and configuration used for generating and
evaluating the Genome-in-a-Bottle stratifications. The stratification files were
developed with the Global Alliance for Genomic Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team,
the [Genome in a Bottle Consortium
(GIAB)](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/genome-bottle) and the
[Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium
(T2T)](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup). They are intended as
a standard resource of BED files for use in stratifying true positive, false
positive and false negative variant calls in challenging and targeted regions of
the the genome.

The stratification BED files are only accessible on the [GIAB FTP
site](https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/genome-stratifications/).
These files can be used as a standard resource of BED files for use with GA4GH
benchmark tools such as [hap.py](https://github.com/Illumina/hap.py).

These files were generated using the configuration
[here](https://github.com/ndwarshuis/giab-stratifications) and the pipeline
located [here](https://github.com/ndwarshuis/giab-strats-smk). Please see these
for further information, including exact code and source files.

Currently, this pipeline is set up to build stratifications for the following
references:
* GRCh37
* GRCh38
* CHM13

## Summary Of Stratifications

Stratifications can be binned into several types. General information for
stratification types are provided below.

These categories are present for all indicated references unless otherwise
noted.

### Low Complexity

Regions with different types and sizes of low complexity sequence, e.g.,
homopolymers, STRs, VNTRs and other locally repetitive sequences.

### Segmental Duplications

Regions with segmental duplications (generally defined as repeated regions >1kb
with >90% similarity).

### XY

Chomosome XY specific regions such as PAR, XTR or ampliconic.

### Functional Regions

Regions to stratify variants inside and outside coding regions.

### GC Content

Regions with different ranges (%) of GC content.

### Mappability

Regions where short read mapping can be challenging.

### Telomeres

Telomeric regions. These are included for CHM13 only.

### Union

Regions with different general types of difficult regions or any type of
difficult region or complex variant. For example, performance can be measured in
just "easy" or "all difficult" regions of the genome.

### Ancestry

Regions with inferred patterns of local ancestry.

These only exist for GRCh38.

### Genome Specific (GIAB benchmark v4.2.1)

Difficult regions due to potentially difficult variation in a NIST/GIAB sample,
including 1) regions containing putative compound heterozygous variants 2) small
regions containing multiple phased variants, 3) regions with potential
structural or copy number variation.

These only exist for GRCh37/8.

### Functional Technically Difficult

Functional, or potentially functional, regions that are also likely to be
technically difficult to sequences.

These only exist for GRCh37/8.

### Other Difficult

These regions that are difficult to sequences for miscellaneous reasons. In the
case of GRCh37/38, these include regions near gaps or errors in the reference or
regions that are known to be expanded/collapsed relative to most other genomes.

This category also includes highly polymorphic regions such as those coding the
major histocompatibility complex (MHC), the VDJ regions, and regions coding the
killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR). These are all highly polymorphic
in nature and thus difficult to sequence.

Finally, in the case of CHM13, this category also includes the rDNA arrays.
