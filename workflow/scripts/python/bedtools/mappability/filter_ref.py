# This is the one exception to the pattern wherein we filter all input data to
# the chromosomes we actually care about. In the case of mappability, we want to
# run GEM against all random/unplaced contigs, since these are hard to map to
# begin with (otherwise they wouldn't be unplaced). Here, we need to filter
# the fasta to include all the primary contigs we care about + all the other
# unplaced/random contigs. Later we will filter out all the non-primary contigs.
