# dynamic.yml - testing/example configuration for stratifications pipeline
#
# The following is an example of how to configure the pipeline. Users wishing
# to generate their own stratifications may use this as a starting point for
# generating the corresponding configuration.
#
# On a macro level, there are two levels of configuration: 'stratifications'
# and 'builds'. 'Stratification' refers to a reference fasta file and its
# associated source files. A 'build' is a specific instance of a
# 'stratification' which filters for the desired chromosomes and stratification
# types.
#
# The full specification of this file and its structure can be found in the
# 'GiabStrats' class in workflow/scripts/python/common/config.py. To make things
# easier, the most important information is documented here.
#
# The top level defines each of the stratfications, in this case named 'GRCh38',
# 'GRCh37', etc.
stratifications:
  GRCh38:
    # The fasta for this stratification's reference.
    ref:
      src:
        # Location of the fasta (either url or filepath). Note that if this is
        # a local file, the pipeline will raise an error if the file does
        # not exist. If the file is not bgzipped, it will be bgzipped on the
        # fly when downloaded
        #
        # filepath: path/to/local/file
        # url: https://url/to/file

        # MD5 checksum of the file. This is optional, and if not given the
        # checksum could be anything. Recommended to be used after one has
        # committed to using a particular set of inputs, and in particular if
        # one suspects that the sources of said inputs might not be good
        # stewards (eg, they change files without warning).
        #
        # NOTE: the md5 will be calculated against the plain text content of the
        # file rather than the gzipped version (gzip records lots of
        # location-specific data in the file header which will throw off the
        # checksum)

      # weird things will happen. The final stratification beds will also have
      # this pattern. The pattern must include one special directive '%i' which
      # will denote the standard name of the chromosome (1, 2, 3, ...X, Y)
